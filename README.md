###Purposes and goals
We started this as something to do in our spare time, and it still is. TODO: Write something emotional here.

Goals? Ain't nobody got time for that.
###Compilation and Installation
This is still in pre-pre-alpha version, so there is no implementation of all the modules floating around, so you will have to wait if you want to use this.

And about compilation: Later.
###TODOs
*   Write a proper README;
*   Look at TODOs in subdirs;
*   Get more decoders;
*   Make a proper GUI;
*   Make a proper CLI;
*   ~~Add a compile-all CMakeLists file~~;
*   Comments! Comments all around!
*   Edit TODOs.
