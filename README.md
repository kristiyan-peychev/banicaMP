##banica Music Player
###Purposes and goals
We started this as something to do in our spare time, and it still is. TODO: Write something emotional here.
###Compilation and Installation
The player uses CMake as its main build script _for now_.
To build the project just execute:
`mkdir build`
`cd build`
`cmake ..`
`make`

###TODOs
*   Write a proper README;
*   Look at TODOs in subdirs;
*   Get more decoders;
*   Make a proper GUI;
*   Make a proper CLI;
*   ~~Add a compile-all CMakeLists file~~;
*   Comments! Comments all around!
*   Edit TODOs.
